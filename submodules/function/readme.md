```js
// require with prototypes - this require will add prototypes to extend classes and add two constants ($c, $g) to the global space.
// $g is an alias to global and $c is the constant containing all the utility methods and properties.
require('craydent-function');
$c.logit($c.VERSION);
arr.prototypedMethod(args);
```

```js
// require no conflict - this require is the fully modular version with no global constants, prototypes, or methods.
var $c = require('craydent-function/noConflict');
$c.logit($c.VERSION);
$c.prototypedMethod(arr, args);
```

```js
// require global - this require constants and methods in the global space and add prototypes to extend classes.
// $g is an alias to global and $c is the constant containing all the utility methods and properties.
require('craydent-function/global');
logit($c.VERSION);
arr.prototypedMethod(args);
```
